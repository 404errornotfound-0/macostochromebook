Install MacOs on Chromebook



Proceed at Your Own Risk Installing macOS on a Chromebook involves modifying firmware and hardware, which may void warranties, lead to data loss, or result in an unusable device. This process is complex and may not work on all Chromebooks. Ensure you back up your data and understand the risks before proceeding. Neither I nor any referenced sources are responsible for any issues that may arise. Exercise caution and proceed only if you are confident in your technical skills.
